#NVD3 Practice

This is a small project in order to get acquainted with the NVD3 charting library.

###V1

###V2

This includes all 8 groups that we need to worry about as well as the color scheme we want. Bars represent percentage proportions while tooltips give both an absolute count as well as a specific percentage. In this case, the population size was 100 for Group 1, so the percentage is the same as the population proportion.

###V3

This iteration styles up the charts to reflect how the client wants the stacked bars to be handled as well as percentage labeling the y-axis. I changed some of the nvd3 css rules by commenting them out where appropriate and substituting my own in styles.css.

###V4

We have to support multiple types of charts, so this iteration includes a tri-stack bar chart with reusable JS code for either style. The user has to merely supply a properly formatted JSON object and call the right chart.
